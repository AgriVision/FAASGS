######### LOCATION OPTIONS ####################
#   This options are for the UI and Web showing
CALL=CO7WT
NAME=Pavel
LOC=FL11bj
LOC_NAME="Camaguey"
LOC_COUNTRY="Cuba"

######### UI OPTIONS ####################

### Allow to erase the folder when a bad image or a empty recording?
#   set this var to "no" if you are publishing this over the internet
#   or anyone will be allowed to erase the recorded data!
#
# Set this to yes to allow folder removal [yes/no]
ALLOW_REMOVE_FOLDER="yes"

######### RTL-SDR OPTIONS ####################

### Error calibration, aka ppm correction
#   Almost all RTL-SDR dongles has an error in the clock source, and
#   it's usually expressed in ppm deviation from the standard frequency
#
#   FM demodulators are not critical with deviations of even 1 or more
#   kHz, so calibration here is not a big issue but is better to stay
#   on the correct side of the road, take a peek on the README section
#   named "RTL-SDR Calibration" to know how detect your device ppm
#   error.
#
# Set the ppm error of your RTL-SDR for example: -23.4, 34.6, etc
# mine is 75.5 if in doubt set it to 0
RTL_PPM=75.5

######### AUDIO OPTIONS ####################

### Streamed or Step by step audio processing
#   This issue has a few implications and you must select the better
#   choice for your setup. There are two major approaches here:
#
#   # Streamed audio processing:
#     Processing is done in a streamed process, all software works on
#     a stream and piped on each other
#     - Pros: less SD wear as you only write the final files
#     - Cons: on slow systems (Raspi 2, Raspi Zero) or when you have
#       the SBC multitasking you may lose samples and you will get
#       broken images on NOAAs and skips on the audio sats
#
#   # Step by Step audio processing:
#     Processing is done one operation at a time (reception, resampling,
#     etc)
#     - Pros: less chance of audio skips on slow or multitasking systems
#     - Cons: More SD wear out, (if you are using an Armbian based SBC
#       as temp files will be on RAM, so no SD wear out.
#
# By default we go in the safe way, step by step audio processing that
# will work on all systems, disable it only if your have a powerful
# or dedicated system [yes/no]
AUDIO_SBS="yes"

######### APT IMAGES OPTIONS ####################

### Auto-crop images
#   Raw images are built for the entire audio recording, with a
#   section of noise to image transition at start and another
#   of image to noise at the end.
#
#   The software can crop this noisy sections but if your antenna
#   is not good and you have a strong fading on the middle of the
#   pass the software can see it and think it's the end transition
#   and your images can be prematurely cropped.
#
# Set this to yes to auto crop the images [yes/no]
APT_AUTOCROP="yes"

### Crop the telemetry stripes
#   The images have always a tripe of telemetry data on both sides, with
#   this option you can remove this stripes from the final images.
#
# Set this to yes to auto crop telemetry stripes [yes/no]
APT_CROP_TELEMETRY="yes"

### Oversampling the image from the audio to get a 50% larger image
#   The software can oversampling the audio file to get 50% larger
#   image than normal. This can lead to some artifacts when
#   processing some "fake" enhancements, but tolerable.
#
# set this option to "yes" to enable image oversampling [yes/no]
APT_OVERSAMPLE="yes"

### Default image format
#   The software can output images in various formats:
#   - BMP: Full details, bigger size
#   - PNG: Full details, medium size
#   - JPEG: Moderate details (low compression), small size
#
#   We recommend using PNG/JPEG as BMP is not supported
#
# set this option to "jpg" or "png" to use that kind of images
APT_IMAGE_FORMAT="jpg"

### Place a cross on the QTH/Location of the user
#   The software can put a cross in the map in the city you
#   described on the LOC_NAME/LOC_COUNTRY, variables above
#
#   Take into account that only city bigger than 100k people
#   will be known.
#
# set this option to "yes" to place a cross on your location [yes/no]
APT_MAP_QTH="yes"

### Put major cities on the map
#   The software can place a dot on major cities [population over 200k]
#
# set this option to "yes" to display major cities [yes/no]
APT_CITIES="yes"

### Draw earth artifacts (rives, lakes, borders...)
#   The software can draw lakes, rivers, borders, fill heath, lakes, etc
#
# set this option to "yes" to draw artifacts on the maps [yes/no]
APT_ARTIFACTS="yes"

### Map vs image slant correction
#   You need a precise QTH location and clock source and even with
#   the you may find that the map is not where it must be, with
#   this two vars you are able to move the map (not the image)
#
# positive values (pixels) move the map right
SLANT_X=0
# positive values (pixels) move the map down
SLANT_Y=10

######### PROXY OPTIONS ####################

### Modify this to fit your needs for a PROXY, below I set a few examples
# for the proxy settings (Authentication only works with BASIC schema)
#
#   http_proxy="http://10.42.1.10:3128/"
#   http_proxy="http://pavel:pass0rd@10.42.1.10:3128/"
#
# both variables contains the same data, so just put one of them
#
http_proxy=""
#
# set the other var
https_proxy=$http_proxy
